Stage 3:
a) store the data from stage 2 in a file With two columns:
Example table:
#simulation/iteration and
sim#    #guesses    #delta zu avg
1       1           1-3 = 2
2       3
3       5
4       6
1000    6


b) calculate the avg(#guesses)
c) calculate deviation per iteration (simulation) from #of guesses to avg(#guesses)
d) print the top 10 result in ascending order of the absolute deviation number
